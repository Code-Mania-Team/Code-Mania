    "description": "Every C++ program follows a specific structure so the compiler knows how to build and run it. The line #include <iostream> tells the program to include the input-output stream library, which allows us to use cout to display text on the screen. Without it, the program would not recognize cout. The line using namespace std; lets us write cout instead of std::cout. Every C++ program must have a main() function because it is the entry point where execution begins. Inside main(), instructions run from top to bottom. The statement return 0; tells the system the program ended successfully. Understanding these parts is important because all C++ programs are built on this structure.",
