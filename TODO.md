# Task: Apply Image Styles to Website

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Step 1: Update hero section in frontend/src/App.jsx (change title to "LEARN TO CODE", add subtitle, update button to "Start Learning").

- [ ] Step 2: Add new practice section in frontend/src/App.jsx after hero and before featured languages (two-column with cards: "Practice your coding challenges" left with green/yellow badge and Frog icon, "Apply what you've learned" right with similar badge).

- [ ] Step 3: Update learn section in frontend/src/App.jsx (confirm text and button "Start Coding Now").

- [ ] Step 4: Update frontend/src/App.css global styles (navy bg #001f3f, Inter font bold, green #10b981 / yellow #f59e0b accents; clean redundancies like multiple .learn-text definitions).

- [ ] Step 5: Add/refine CSS for hero (solid navy, centered bold text), practice section (grid layout, gradient cards/badges), learn (two-column navy, blue button), featured (green/yellow hover borders).

- [ ] Step 6: Read frontend/src/index.css and edit if global body conflicts (e.g., ensure dark navy).

- [ ] Step 7: Execute `cd frontend && npm run dev` to start Vite server.

- [ ] Step 8: Use browser_action to launch http://localhost:5173, scroll/verify hero/practice/learn sections match images (dark navy, gradients, layout), close browser.

- [ ] Step 9: Update TODO.md with completions and finalize.

Progress: Step 1 complete. Proceeding to Step 2.
